            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, Welcome back to my weekly trash of the week blog. This week I have some 
                very important things to share with you. These items have been very useful to me and that is 
                why I do this blog anyways. I do this because I want to keep track of all the things that have 
                helped me in one way or another. By keeping track of these things I can come back later to visit 
                what I have been doing for each week. This project is similar to Bogost's ideas on an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ontography">ontography</a> project.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I work on creating a website to document my environmental footprint and track my trash output, I can't help but notice the similarities and differences between my project and an ontography. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bogost">Ian Bogost's</a> writing on ontography describes a practice that accounts for the various units that exist throughout the universe. In a similar way, my website is focused on mapping out and understanding the entities that make up my personal waste output. However, while my website and ontography share some similarities, there are also important differences to consider.
<br>
<br>
One key difference is the scope and comprehensiveness of the two projects. While my website is focused on tracking and reducing my personal waste output, ontography is a broader practice that accounts for all the units that make up the universe. My website may be able to provide insight into my individual environmental impact, but it cannot address the larger systemic issues that contribute to environmental harm. Ontography, on the other hand, aims to account for all units, including those that may be invisible or overlooked, and reveal the underlying complexity of the world.
<br>
<br>
Another difference between my website and ontography is their respective goals. While my website is practical and action-oriented, ontography is a theoretical and philosophical practice. My website aims to help me take concrete steps towards reducing my environmental impact, while ontography seeks to reveal the rich variety of being and understand the relationships between entities. These different goals highlight the tension between practical action and philosophical inquiry, and prompt us to consider how these different approaches can be integrated to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of environmental issues.
<br>
<br>
Despite these differences, there are also important similarities between my website and ontography. "ontography can take the form of a compendium, a record of things <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juxtaposed">juxtaposed</a> to demonstrate their overlap and imply interaction through collocation" (Bogost 38). Both practices involve mapping out and understanding the entities that make up a particular system. In my case, this system is my personal waste output, while in ontography the system is the universe. Both practices also seek to reveal underlying relationships and interactions between entities. My website may not be as all-encompassing as ontography, but it still aims to shed light on the relationships between the various entities that make up my waste output.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the similarities and differences between my website and ontography prompt important questions about the role of personal action in addressing environmental issues. As he says, "The practice of ontography and it is a practice, not merely a theory describes the many processes of accounting for the various units that strew themselves throughout the universe" (Bogost 50). On the one hand, my website is focused on individual behaviors, which may seem insufficient in the face of larger systemic problems. On the other hand, ontography highlights the importance of accounting for all units, including those that may be invisible or overlooked. These different approaches prompt us to consider how personal action can be integrated into larger systemic change, and how we can account for the various units that contribute to environmental harm.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, the practice of ontography and my website documenting my environmental footprint share some similarities, such as the mapping out and understanding of entities, and some differences, such as their respective scopes and goals. While my website may not be as comprehensive as ontography, it still seeks to shed light on the entities and relationships that make up my personal waste output. The similarities and differences between the two practices prompt important questions about the role of personal action in addressing environmental issues, and highlight the tension between practical action and theoretical inquiry. Ultimately, the integration of these different approaches may be necessary to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of environmental issues and to drive meaningful change.

            <div class="Electronic Items">
                <h3>Electronic Items</h3>
                <p>The first category is the most important one and it is electronics. The first item is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker">speaker</a> 
                    which does not work anymore. The speaker looks like a round item with a sucction cup on the 
                    bottom to stick to any surface. I got this on thanksgiving like 2 years ago because it was on a 
                    sale. This speaker was great and I had some good times listening to music on it. Unfortunately I 
                    have to throw it away now because it does not work. The second item in this group are 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery">batteries</a>. I got these batteries for common use electronics at home. I got these about three 
                    weeks ago. The reason I had to throw them away is obviously because they ran out of charge. 
                    The third and most important item on this list for me is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller">controller</a>. This item is important 
                    because I had been using this controller ever since I got the xbox which was about five years 
                    ago. I have many memories with this controller because of fun gaming sessions. The reason I 
                    have to throw it away is because the controller does not turn on anymore.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Cloth Items">
                <h3>Cloth Items</h3>
                <p>This is the second category which is cloth items. The items in this are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock">socks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel">a wiping towel</a>, and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanket">throw/blanket</a>. The first item is socks which I got about 2 months ago. The reason I had to throw 
                    them away was because they got ripped. The second item is a wiping towel which I used 
                    around the house. It was very useful for cleaning things. I bought this item around a year ago 
                    and have to throw it away because it got too dirty and I have to get a new one. The third item is 
                    a blanket which also got too dirty and old. I bought it like 2 years ago and it was useful. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Home Decor Items">
                <h3>Home Decor Items</h3>
                <p>This is the third category which is home decor items. The items in this category are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle">candle holder</a> 
                    , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_plants">an artificial plant</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_art">a glass mushroom</a>. The first item is a candle holder which I got 
                    about 2 months ago. The reason I had to replace it was because it got broken. The second item 
                    is an artificial plant which I had in my living room. It was very useful for adding some greenery to 
                    the space. I bought this item around a year ago and had to replace it because it had faded and 
                    lost its color. The third item is a glass mushroom which I had on my bookshelf. I bought it like 2 
                    years ago and it was a unique and interesting addition to my home decor. However, over time it 
                    got dusty and didn't look as nice, so I had to replace it.

            <p>Alright folks, another week down and it's time to wrap up my weekly "Trash of the Week" blog. Next week, I'll be digging deeper into my trash and sharing some of the ways I'm working to reduce my waste, like using reusable bags and containers, and recycling more. I want to thank all of my readers for following my journey and for supporting my mission of becoming more conscious of my trash footprint. Let's all strive to make a positive impact on the environment by reducing the amount of trash we produce. Thanks for reading and see you next week!</p>

            <p>In conclusion, working on this project to document my environmental footprint has been an eye-opening experience that has taught me about the impact of my daily activities on the environment. Through this project, I have gained a better understanding of the various entities that make up my waste output, and I have been able to take practical steps towards reducing my impact on the environment.

                However, as I continue to work on this project, I am also aware of its limitations and the larger systemic issues that contribute to environmental harm. I am reminded of the need for collective action to address these issues, and I am committed to using my voice and actions to advocate for policies and practices that promote sustainability and protect our planet. So I made a <a href="https://peer.org/get-involved/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAgOefBhDgARIsAMhqXA6MUc-V6OIZwxhE_fsJXvQxK5eWFeyq-WSA3CFWtjTQsLuqHCEJ_QYaAkUrEALw_wcB">website</a> that informs people about enviromental news
                
                Overall, this project has been an important step towards a more environmentally conscious lifestyle, and I hope to inspire others to take similar actions towards creating a more sustainable future.</p>
