            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, Welcome back to my weekly trash of the week blog. This week I have some 
                very important things to share with you. These items have been very useful to me and that is 
                why I do this blog anyways. I do this because I want to keep track of all the things that have 
                helped me in one way or another. By keeping track of these things I can come back later to visit 
                what I have been doing for each week.
            </p>
            <div class="Electronic Items">
                <h3>Electronic Items</h3>
                <p>The first category is the most important one and it is electronics. The first item is a speaker 
                    which does not work anymore. The speaker looks like a round item with a sucction cup on the 
                    bottom to stick to any surface. I got this on thanksgiving like 2 years ago because it was on a 
                    sale. This speaker was great and I had some good times listening to music on it. Unfortunately I 
                    have to throw it away now because it does not work. The second item in this group are 
                    batteries. I got these batteries for common use electronics at home. I got these about three 
                    weeks ago. The reason I had to throw them away is obviously because they ran out of charge. 
                    The third and most important item on this list for me is the controller. This item is important 
                    because I had been using this controller ever since I got the xbox which was about five years 
                    ago. I have many memories with this controller because of fun gaming sessions. The reason I 
                    have to throw it away is because the controller does not turn on anymore.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Cloth Items">
                <h3>Cloth Items</h3>
                <p>This is the second category which is cloth items. The items in this are socks, a wiping towel, and 
                    throw/blanket. The first item is socks which I got about 2 months ago. The reason I had to throw 
                    them away was because they got ripped. The second item is a wiping towel which I used 
                    around the house. It was very useful for cleaning things. I bought this item around a year ago 
                    and have to throw it away because it got too dirty and I have to get a new one. The third item is 
                    a blanket which also got too dirty and old. I bought it like 2 years ago and it was useful. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Home Decor Items">
                <h3>Home Decor Items</h3>
                <p>This is the third category which is home decor items. The items in this category are a candle 
                    holder, an artificial plant, and a glass mushroom. The first item is a candle holder which I got 
                    about 2 months ago. The reason I had to replace it was because it got broken. The second item 
                    is an artificial plant which I had in my living room. It was very useful for adding some greenery to 
                    the space. I bought this item around a year ago and had to replace it because it had faded and 
                    lost its color. The third item is a glass mushroom which I had on my bookshelf. I bought it like 2 
                    years ago and it was a unique and interesting addition to my home decor. However, over time it 
                    got dusty and didn't look as nice, so I had to replace it.

            <p>Alright folks, another week down and it's time to wrap up my weekly "Trash of the Week" blog. Next week, I'll be digging deeper into my trash and sharing some of the ways I'm working to reduce my waste, like using reusable bags and containers, and recycling more. I want to thank all of my readers for following my journey and for supporting my mission of becoming more conscious of my trash footprint. Let's all strive to make a positive impact on the environment by reducing the amount of trash we produce. Thanks for reading and see you next week!</p>
